# Blerminal
Blerminal is the popular casino game Blackjack, but playable through a computer's terminal. The reason why I created this project is because I enjoy playing Blackjack and wanted to see if I can recreate the game on my machine. This tested both my programming skills and knowledge about how the game of Blackjack operates. The features that were implemented are listed below.
- Has a betting/gambling system.
- Players can hit, stand, double down and forfeit matches.
- Fully-functioning and competitive CPU and Dealer that focuses on winning.
- CPU can hit and stand based on their decision-making process.
- Easy, Normal and Hard Difficulties 
- Money gained or lost is saved by writing to a file.
- Implements all of the key rules and aspects of Blackjack.

With more time, these are the features I would've liked to implement into this project:
- Use reward function and heuristics to influence the CPU's decision-making.
- Add Split functionality and rules (not a fan of Split)
- Add more competitive CPUs with different playstyles. 
- Add a GUI to make Blackjack look more visually appealing and easier to use for users.
- Use GLUT or SFML to create 2D/3D cards for the user, cpus and dealer along with a nice background with cozy background music (Visually Appealing and better user experience!)
- Make the project more object-oriented.
